# Library System using Dart

This is a simple command-line library management system implemented in Dart. It allows you to manage a library's collection of books, including searching for books, adding new books, deleting books, making purchases, editing book details, and generating reports.

## Description:

The Library Project is a command-line application developed in Dart that provides a user-friendly interface for managing a library's collection of books. This system offers a range of features, making it easy to search for books, add new books to the library, delete existing books, purchase books, edit book details, generate reports, and even categorize and display books by their categories.
